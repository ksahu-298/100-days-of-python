Today is day 6th of my 100 days coding journey. Today I studied about how to create functions in python on a 3rd party website called as Reeborg's World Hurdles
Here's the link "https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%201&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle1.json"

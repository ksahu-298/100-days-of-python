Today is Day 19th of my 100 days coding challenge, tpday I deep dive in module turtle & learn about it's some predefined functions through this I was able to make a game called as turtle race in which I can also make a bet on a turtle.
I also make a Etch-a-sketch which is simply a canvas in which we can draw using keyboard
